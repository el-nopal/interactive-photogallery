=== PROJECT 5 - AN INTERACTIVE PHOTOGALLERY ===

Description:

In this project, you will create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions. At the top of the page, you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous arrows to cycle through photos.

Instructions:

Build the web page layout using HTML and CSS, using the layout in the gallery_mockup.png file.
Create a gallery using the provided thumbnail images.
Create a search box field.
The design does not need to be exact, but the general spacing and arrangement of the elements should match the design of the mockups.

Research, find and implement a jQuery plugin for a lightbox. This must include the following functionality and features:
The ability to click on thumbnail images in the gallery and view them in a lightbox.
A background overlay that appears and covers the entire window when displaying a larger image.
The ability to add text captions to each image in the lightbox.
Back and forward arrows to switch between photos when the lightbox is visible.
Make sure there is a way to close the lightbox and return to the gallery view.


Research, find and implement a jQuery plugin for the search box. This must include the following functionality and features:
The search box at the top of the page should filters photos based on the captions.
The photos should filter in real-time as you type, and only display photos that match the search.
    
Extra Credit:


Include a mobile-first design for both the gallery page and the lightbox:

Use media queries to make sure that the photos and layout adjust for a mobile-friendly experience.

Write your own JavaScript or jQuery code instead of using a jQuery plugin for the search/content filtering requirement.
